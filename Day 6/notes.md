🚀 Day 6 - AWS & DevOps Challenge! 🌿💻
 Successfully hosted "My Plant Info" website on AWS S3! 🎉 Enabled ACLs for object permissions and made it publicly accessible. Learning and growing every day in this DevOps journey! 🌱 
Why We Use This?
Hosting a static website on AWS S3 is cost-effective, scalable, and highly available. By enabling ACL (Access Control Lists), we control object permissions, ensuring proper access management for public or restricted content. This is a key practice in DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure management.
Steps to Host a Static Website on AWS S3:
 1️⃣ Create an S3 Bucket → Name it as per website requirements.
 2️⃣ Enable Static Website Hosting → Go to bucket properties and enable it.
 3️⃣ Upload Website Files → HTML, CSS, JS files.
 4️⃣ Set Object ACL Permissions → Enable public access for required files.
 5️⃣ Edit Bucket Policy → Allow public read access (if needed).
 6️⃣ Access Website via S3 Endpoint → Use the given endpoint to access the hosted website.
