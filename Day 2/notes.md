📢 Day 2 of My AWS & DevOps Challenge Series! 🚀
 Today, I explored AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) — a fully managed messaging service that enables message delivery from publishers to subscribers through various protocols like email, SMS, HTTP, and more. 📧
🔍 What I did:
   Created an SNS Topic.
   Added an email subscription.
   Published a message: "Hello, Test email for SNS. Thanks!"
AWS SNS is great for event-driven architecture, push notifications, and system monitoring. Plus, it's super easy to integrate with other AWS services.
