🚀 AWS & DevOps Challenge - Day 7 🌐 | Setting Up a VPC & Launching an EC2 Instance
Built a custom VPC, created subnets, attached an Internet Gateway, configured a Route Table, and launched a Windows EC2 instance to validate internet connectivity via ping 8.8.8.8. Successfully set up a secure and scalable network environment in AWS! ✅
What I Achieved:
 ✔️ Created a custom VPC for better network control
 ✔️ Set up subnets for structured network segmentation
 ✔️ Configured an Internet Gateway to allow outbound traffic
 ✔️ Set up a Route Table to define traffic flow
 ✔️ Launched a Windows EC2 Instance within the VPC
 ✔️ Verified Internet Connectivity using ping 8.8.8.8
Why We Use This?
Custom VPC: Ensures better security and control over resources
Subnets: Help segment the network for efficient resource allocation
Internet Gateway: Enables communication with the internet
Route Table: Defines how traffic moves within the VPC
EC2 in Custom VPC: Provides isolated, scalable compute resources
Ping 8.8.8.8: Confirms that the instance has internet access
This setup is essential for deploying secure, scalable applications on AWS! 🚀
