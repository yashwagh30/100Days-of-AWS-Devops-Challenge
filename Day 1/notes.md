🌟 Day 1 of My AWS & DevOps Challenge Series! 🚀
I just deployed a basic static website hosted on AWS EC2 using an RDP Client! 🖥️✨
Here's a quick overview of the process:
  EC2 Instance Setup: Launched a Windows-based EC2 instance and configured security groups.
  Remote Access: Connected to the instance via RDP Client for a smooth GUI experience.
  Web Server Configuration: Installed IIS (Internet Information Services) to serve the static files.
  File Deployment: Uploaded HTML/CSS files directly to the server.
  Access Configuration: Adjusted inbound rules to allow HTTP traffic.
  Testing: Confirmed the website is live and accessible! 🌐
✅ A straightforward yet powerful start to my AWS & DevOps journey.
