🚀 Day 4 of AWS & DevOps Challenge - Automating EC2 Instance Management with Lambda & IAM! 🌩️💪
Today, I took another step forward in my AWS & DevOps journey by automating EC2 instance management using AWS Lambda and IAM Policies. The goal? To automatically stop EC2 instances using a Python-based Lambda function. Here's how I did it:
✅ Steps I Followed:
Creating an IAM Role:
Defined a role for Lambda with an IAM policy granting permission to stop EC2 instances.
Writing the Lambda Function:
Developed a Python script to identify and stop instances using the boto3 library.
Defined appropriate triggers and permissions for execution.
Testing & Deploying:
Tested the function with various scenarios to ensure proper functionality.
Successfully stopped the EC2 instance through the Lambda function! 🎉
💡 Why This Matters:
Automating cloud operations with Lambda functions helps enhance cost-efficiency, security, and resource management.
