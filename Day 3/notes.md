Day 3: Automating EC2 Instance Management with AWS! 🚀
Today, I worked on setting up an automated monitoring and alert system for an EC2 instance using AWS CloudWatch, SNS, and EC2.
✅ Why it's used:
 In a real-world scenario, sudden spikes in CPU utilization can indicate performance issues or overuse of resources. Automating instance management ensures better cost control and reliability without manual intervention.
🔍 How it's used:
  AWS CloudWatch: Monitors CPU utilization metrics of an EC2 instance.
  Alarm Setup: A threshold limit is set (e.g., 80%). If CPU usage exceeds this limit, the alarm is triggered.
  SNS (Simple Notification Service): Sends an email notification when the alarm is triggered.
  Automatic Action: The instance is stopped automatically to prevent overuse and optimize resource allocation.
💡 Real-World Use Case: Cost-saving, auto-scaling, or security enforcement when instances show abnormal behavior.
